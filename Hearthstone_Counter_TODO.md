# To Do
- [x] Refactor Writer(s).cs and Reader(s).cs code into one method(or close)
- [x] Make all wins in one textfile
- [x] Make all losses in one textfile
- [x] Fix names and inconsistancies in code
- [x] Bring down text files to 2
- [x] Bring down text files to 1
- [x] Add ability to add multiple wins/losses at once.
- [x] Refactor the reset/win/lose button code so that we have only 1 button, not 9
- [x] Add the ability to save a log file
- [x] Move the logic of adding wins to AddWins.cs(to fix a bug where when you reset the wins and add new wins it adds them onto the previously reset wins, due to the new constructors) and remove the form closed events.
- [x] Add ability to select classes with the arrow keys
- [x] Remove the (Class)ButtonClicked() method inside every class' ResetButtonClicked method and replace it with what's necessary(most likely only ReadWins & ReadLosses)

There surely are more things to be done, I'll look into them later
